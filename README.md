Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple Two player game.
One player plays with X and the other player plays with O.
Python Libraries are used to build this game.Instead of asking the user to put a mark on the board,code randomly chooses a place on the board and put the mark.
It will display the board after each turn unless a player wins.
